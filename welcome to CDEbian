Welcome to CDEbian 0.8!

This release updates CDE and Debian through March 30, 2013. 

This is a work in progress, things might break. Then again, maybe not.
Beneath the innocent facade of CDE is Debian Squeeze i386, so feel free to
fiddle until the cows come home or at least until they are on the grill.

A HUGE thanks to those who worked to get CDE to the unwashed masses. I take NO 
credit for their work. I decided to put this together simply for the joy of 
using my favorite desktop environment again. Join us: #cde on irc.freenode.net

In addition to the security of PGP, TOR, and Vidalia, this release brings
world-changing technology in the form of Bitcoin and Litecoin and includes
the popular CGMiner and CPUminer with scrypt support. The AMD APP and ADL
SDKs are also installed, enabling CDEbian to be a complete cryptocurrency 
solution with LiveCD ease--just add a Radeon and the Linux Catalyst Drivers.

See ~/changelog for more info. As before, root's password is: HarlemShake!

Enjoy!
